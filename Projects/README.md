# 📂 Projects

This folder contains all application projects currently in development.  
Each project should have its own dedicated subfolder here.

## 🆕 Creating a New Project
1. Inside `/Projects`, create a folder with your project name:

```
Projects/
└── projectName/
```
2. Add a `README.md` inside your project folder to describe:
- Project purpose  
- Team members / owners  
- Setup instructions  
- Any dependencies
- **Version Control**

3. Keep all code, assets, and documentation for the project **inside its folder**.  

---

## 📝 Naming Conventions
- Use **camelCase** for project folder names: `myNewApp/`  
- Keep names **short and descriptive**.  
- Avoid spaces (use `-` or camelCase instead).  

---

## 🔄 Version Control Guidelines
- Always pull from `main` before starting work.  
- Commit frequently with **clear messages**:
- Add the new version number to the `README.md` with a short description of the updates made.

## 📚 Project Documentation
Each project folder should include:  
- `README.md` → overview, setup, usage, verison control  
- `docs/` (optional) → design notes, diagrams, extra docs  
- `tests/` (if applicable) → test scripts for that project
